# practical-logic: <br> CLP(FD) exploratory, <br> with OCaml->JavaScript

Constraint-Logic Programming over Finite Domains using tricks of the trade
developed through self-study of the textbook
"Handbook of Practical Logic and Automated Reasoning" by John Harrison
([goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/7475215))
and various related research papers, as cited throughout.

Progress through the book is marked by separate branches for the content of
each chapter, with additional subordinate branches for each exercise
completed (with a writeup in the root README and additional code as appropiate
for the exercise).
You may choose to follow along with your own progress in the book, or select
a particular section of interest, and easily see the diff between it and its
predecessor, or to try alternate design paths from certain early points in the
book.  The following table of contents links to the relevant branches for
completed sections and exercises.

The code here deviates from that in the book, and the `main` branch will often
elide or modify significant parts of the original source code.  Sometimes this
is done simply to my taste and sometimes it is in service of the
[interactive solver](https://kevindamm.github.io/practical-logic)
made available as a web application
  via [`js_of_ocaml`](https://github.com/ocsigen/js_of_ocaml)
  and [*Vitepress*](https://vitepress.dev/)
  and hosted on [GitHub Pages](https://docs.github.com/pages).


1. Introduction

    * [ch 1.1-1.8](https://github.com/kevindamm/practical-logic/blob/ch1/Summary.md)

      This section is represented within one branch due to the relative simplicity
      of the introductory chapters.
      The code at this point is a simple parser in OCaml for evaluating arithmetic
      and boolean expressions.\
